I'd like to share a bunch of insights about my work here. Every day I'm digging into the client side code of webapps. So, it's fair to say that I'm quite familiar with stuff like HTML, CSS and JS. I'm particularly interested in:
<ul>
	<li>CSS tooling (Sass, PostCSS)</li>
	<li>Writing scalable and maintainable stylesheets</li>
	<li>Web typography</li>
</ul>

When I'm not coding (and it happens quite often, I'd say), I like to experiment with vegetarian cuisine, try to stay fit or browse the web to find an inspiration for my next trip. Besides, I'm a language & literature geek and cannot imagine a day without reading at least a few pages of a book (sci-fi or non-fiction, preferably).

Currently I'm based in <a href="https://www.google.pl/maps/place/Warszawa/@52.232938,21.0611941,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x471ecc669a869f01:0x72f0be2a88ead3fc?hl=pl">Warsaw</a>, working at <a href="http://10clouds.com">10Clouds</a> as a front-end dev.
