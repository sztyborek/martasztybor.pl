Although most people perceive software development as a solitary work, it's actually quite opposite. Apart from having excellent coding skills, a good dev should also prove herself as a valuable team player. Satisfying soft skills are really useful on a daily basis &ndash; for discussions about technical solutions, code reviews and receiving criticism from your colleagues. 

During [The Awwwesomes](https://theawwwesomes.org) workshops and afterwards we've received a lot of feedback (including opinions about our tutorial). That was the first time for me producing an open-source work. I had an opportunity to teach front-end to really awesome people (and it's genuinely rewarding), but also learned a lot of stuff.

## Receiving criticism

Criticism is an inevitable part of your growth. Nobody's perfect and there's always a room for improvement. It's worth to remember that negative feedback is not the end of your world, although certainly it's a bitter pill to swallow. 

### Assume they had good intentions

Ktoś, kto poświęcił czas na zapoznanie się z Twoją pracą z pewnością nie miał złych intencji

### Don't take it personally

### Be positive

### Show your gratitude

Every cloud has a silver lining. The person who's giving you negative feedback took her time to consume and review your work &ndash; isn't it nice to know that somebody shows it their interest? Going further, giving <i>any</i> feedback means showing concern about the work. Be grateful, don't forget to say <i>"thank you"</i> in response!


## Giving criticism

### Be concise and to the point

Any fluff added to your opinion can blur the objective, which is to point out mistakes in somebody's work. 

### Criticise the work, not the author

Do not show your superiority

### Give praise for the strong points

Although I previously mentioned being concise, I'd advise


Thank you for reading!
