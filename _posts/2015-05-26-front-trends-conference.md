title:      5 Lessons Learned at the Front-Trends 2015 Conference
date:       2015-05-26 01:00:00
summary:    This month Iâ€™ve attended the Front-Trends conference, an annual event gathering front-end professionals, mobile devs and UI/UX designers from all over the world. The event was held in Warsaw (the venue was again the Fabryka Trzciny art center) on 6-8 May. During these three days we had an opportunity to hear many inspirational talks, meet technology experts and share our experience with a great amount of other developers attending the conference.
