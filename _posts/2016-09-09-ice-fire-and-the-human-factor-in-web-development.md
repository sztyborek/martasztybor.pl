summary:    The first things you see through the window as the plane approaches the Keflavik airport are a lunar landscape and glaciers. Could you imagine a more exotic place for a JavaScript conference? I was so excited to attend JSConf Iceland not only because of the lineup, but also the surroundings. Iceland is probably one of the most beautiful places in the world!
