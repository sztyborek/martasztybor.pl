Keeping up to date in the front-end industry [is really hard to accomplish](https://timkadlec.com/2015/09/the-fallacy-of-keeping-up/). But certainly it's worth trying. I subscribe blogs via RSS, follow people from the industry on Twitter and listen to podcasts. One of my favourite ways to gather latest news are mailing lists, here's why:

- Like any other newsletters, they are addressed personally to you (although definitely you're just the one among lots of other subscribers). When I receive a new issue of a certain newsletter, I have a similiar feeling like opening a traditional mailbox. And the sense of unpacking a box full of surprises.
- Unlike social media
- I am assured of the quality of the content I can find


If you haven't already decided to subscribe any reading list, here are some of them I can recommend (their order is random):
