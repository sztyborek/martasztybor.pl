        This month I’ve attended the Front-Trends conference, an annual event gathering front-end professionals, mobile devs and UI/UX designers from all over the world. The event was held in Warsaw (the venue was again the Fabryka Trzciny art center) on 6-8 May. During these three days we had an opportunity to hear many inspirational talks, meet technology experts and share our experience with a great amount of other developers attending the conference. <a href="http://10clouds.com/blog/5-lessons-learned-at-the-front-trends-2015-conference/" target="_blank">Read more</a>

        CSS is a fairly simple language to learn on a basic level and to kick off with the coding. But when your stylesheets start to grow, it becomes more and more difficult to untangle messed up classes. Here I collected a couple of tips to help you write more manageable code. They’ll be useful no matter if you’re working on a project’s styles on your own or in a team. <a href="http://10clouds.com/blog/6-steps-to-make-your-css-code-more-maintainable/" target="_blank">Read more</a>
